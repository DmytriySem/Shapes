GEOMETRIC SHAPES

The user selects three arbitrary points in the browser's client area.
When selected, the program highlights their location by building red circles for each selected point.
Circle diameter should be 11 pixels.

Based on these three points, two figures need to be built:
- blue parallelogram, with three vertices at selected points.
- a yellow circle with the same area and center of mass that has parallelograms.

These figures should not be filled.
The coordinates of the selected points, as well as the area of the parallelogram and the circle,
must be presented to the user in numerical order.

The user must move the dots freely in the screen at any time.
Moving the points changes accordingly the image of the parallelogram and the colmat displays the updated shapes.

There should also be a "reset" function that clears the area and allows the user to select three new points
and repeat the described process as described above.

Â You need to implement the function "about", which specifies your own information about the program,
 its author and instructions for its use.
